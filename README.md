# My Second React Project


project developed from scratch as an activity of the week

## How did I do it?

- First, I created a react project using "npx create-react-app project-react"
- Then, I removed the folders and files that were not used for me at that time
- Then, I created the Components folder and inside it, the Title file, containing the props and children for the titles I used
- And finally, I created the List file containing all the code for consuming the Github API, in order to obtain a Search List
and Go Hacking!

### What do I Think?

I just loved doing this project, I have been increasingly enjoying developing in react.



### Thank U, Simara <3
